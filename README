                            HepMCEx03
                            ---------

  This example demonstrates how to interface primary particles in Geant4
with various event generators via the HepMC Monte Carlo event interface.
This is example based on HepMCEx02, but using Pythia 8 instead of Pythia 6.

1. Primary Generator

 H02PrimaryGeneratorAction has HepMCG4Interface as the generator.
There are two types of generators provided as samples. One generator reads 
primary information from a HepMC Ascii file (data_Pythia8ToAscii/example_MyPythia8.dat).
The other one generates primaries directly invoking PYTHIA routines 
in every event.

2. Geometry

  A simplified collider-type geometry, which consists of 
    - endcap calorimeter (a set of tubes filled with lead), 
    - barrel calorimeter (tube filled with lead),
    - barrel muon detector (8 sets of plates filled with Ar),
    - endcap muon detecror, (a set of tubes filled with Ar) and
    - uniform magnetic field along the z axis of 3 Tesla at the 
      central region.

3. Physics List 

  FTFP_BERT predefined physics list

4. User actions

  All particles except muons are killed in the calorimeter section.
